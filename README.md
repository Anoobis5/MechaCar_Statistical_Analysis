# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview

AutosRUs' has tasked our team to help review their production data for insights that may help their manufacturing team's progress. Our analysis aims to:

  * Identify which variables predict the MP for their vehicle prototypes
  * Collect summary statistics on the PSI of the suspencion coils
  * Determine if manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean
  * Design a study to compare performance against vehicles from other competeing manufacturers

## Results

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

[ short summary using a screenshot of the output from linear regression and address the following questions: 
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
